# Dreamstone App: Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how the Dreamstone app collects, uses, and stores your information.

## 1. The Data We Collect

To provide a personalized experience and track your progress, the app collects the following information from your Google Play Games service:

* A **unique, app-specific User ID** provided by Google Play Games. This ID is not tied to your broader Google account or used to track you across other apps or services.
* Your **Name**

We also collect and store your sleep data, such as your self-reported sleep and wake-up times and the points you earn.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Your information is used to:

* **Personalize your app experience** by displaying your name.
* **Store your unique progress** and game data. This data is synced with Google Play Games services to ensure it is securely backed up and available across your devices.
* **Assign points** and manage your in-app rewards.

## 3. Permissions We Request

* **Notifications Permission:** We use this permission to send you important notifications, such as your wake-up alarm or reminders to go to sleep.
* **Full-Screen Intent Permission:** This permission is needed to allow the alarm screen to appear over other apps, ensuring you can't miss your wake-up alarm.

## 4. Data Storage and Syncing

Your app data (including your User ID, name, sleep data, and progress) is synced with **Google Play Games services** to provide cloud backup and allow you to access your progress on different devices.

**We do not store this data on our own company's servers.** It is managed and stored by Google on your behalf as part of the Google Play Games service. For more details on how Google handles your data, please review their privacy policy.

## 5. What We Don't Collect

We do not collect any sensitive information, such as your precise location, contact list, or personal health information beyond the sleep times you manually provide. We do not use third-party advertising or analytics services that collect personal data from you.

## 6. Your Data Control

Since your data is synced with Google's services, you can manage it through your Google account settings.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the policy page within the app. Your continued use of the app after any changes means you accept the new policy.
